# VisaApprovalAnalyzer

# Overview
This project aims to facilitate the process of visa approvals for foreign workers applying to work in the United States. By leveraging machine learning techniques, EasyVisa helps in shortlisting candidates with higher chances of visa approval, thereby streamlining the application review process for the Office of Foreign Labor Certification (OFLC).

# Context
In the United States, businesses face high demand for human resources, often requiring the recruitment of talent from both domestic and international pools. The Immigration and Nationality Act allows foreign workers to work in the U.S. on either a temporary or permanent basis, administered by the OFLC. With an increasing number of visa applications each year, a data-driven solution becomes essential for efficient processing.

# Objective
The objective of EasyVisa is to analyze applicant data and develop a classification model to recommend suitable profiles for visa certification or denial. By identifying key drivers influencing visa status, EasyVisa aims to expedite the approval process while ensuring compliance with statutory requirements.

# Data Description
The dataset comprises various attributes of both employees and employers, including educational background, job experience, prevailing wage, and regional information. These attributes play a crucial role in determining visa certification status. Detailed data dictionary and analysis insights are provided within the project documentation.

# Machine Learning Models
EasyVisa employs several machine learning models, including Random Forest, AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost classifiers. These models are trained on the provided dataset to predict visa certification outcomes based on applicant profiles.

# Recommendations
Based on analysis insights, EasyVisa provides recommendations for applicants likely to have their visa status approved or denied. These recommendations consider primary and secondary information, such as education level, job experience, prevailing wage, continent, and region of employment.

# Future Enhancements
Future enhancements may include gathering additional information on employers and employees to further refine the recommendation system. This could involve collecting data on employer wage offerings, employee specialization, years of experience, and age.
